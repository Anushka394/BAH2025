Bhartiya Antariksh Hackathon 2025  
Project: Lunar Digital Elevation Model Generation using Shape from Shading

This repository contains the code, models, and visualizations developed for the Bhartiya Antariksh Hackathon 2025, aimed at generating high-resolution DEMs of the Moon from single grayscale images using Shape from Shading techniques.

Project Objectives

- Extract elevation data from 2D lunar images
- Use photoclinometry-based models for surface normal estimation
- Build a complete pipeline from image input to DEM output
- Visualize terrain in 2D heatmaps and 3D elevation maps
- Evaluate elevation accuracy against reference datasets

Technologies Used

- Python and NumPy for data handling
- OpenCV for image processing
- PyTorch or TensorFlow for neural SfS models
- Matplotlib and Plotly for DEM visualization
